## Overview
This was a first try at using ASP.NET. I attempted to create a website 
with product posting similar to etsy (hence the name). The website 
currently uses a JSON file as a stand in for a full database, but could
easily be adapted for a larger scale database. It was built with 
the ability to scale in mind.

Included, is the facility to view each product, look in further depth at 
the description and rate each product. It is pretty bare bones as far as
features are concerned, but for a first look at web apps, I am pretty
happy with how it has turned out.

## "Take-aways"
This mini project has helped me to brush up on several skills including:
* use of GitHub
* use of ASP.NET
* server-side scripting
* Blazor
* Html, css, Json, and Java script
* C#

overall I am quite happy with the final project and it has given me
several ideas to apply to future projects.
