## Overview
This was a first try at using ASP.NET. I attempted to create a website 
with product posting similar to etsy (hence the name). The website 
currently uses a JSON file as a stand in for a full database, but could
easily be adapted for a larger scale database. It was built with 
the ability to scale in mind.

Included, is the facility to view each product, look in further depth at 
the description and rate each product. It is pretty bare bones as far as
features are concerned, but for a first look at web apps, I am pretty
happy with how it has turned out.

## "Take-aways"
This mini project has helped me to brush up on several skills including:
* use of GitHub
* use of ASP.NET
* server-side scripting
* Blazor
* Html, css, Json, and Java script
* C#

overall I am quite happy with the final project and it has given me
several ideas to apply to future projects.

### Extra notes
as a note, I attempted to link a working github pages version of the finished web page, however after much trial and error I have found that GitHub pages does not play nice with ASP! the action and yml files are still in the repo, however the deployed page does not work. I am currently looking at other solutions, however, since this is not a full website and only intended as a personal exercise it is unlikely that I will persue this any further for this project. Despite this it has taught me a lot about how GitHub manages static web page deployment, and how to deploy an ASP.NET web page.

No such thing as time wasted! Just new things learnt!
